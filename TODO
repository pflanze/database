- path calculation from hash is in there twice, still, unify
- does with-open really close the streams?
- do exceptions happen when errors happen writing?
- test suite (including emulated OS errors)
- store should have a cache, and a context that's passed around how?
  - optimize saving of objects by checking the cache, and then possibly stat the path (orwrite with EEXCL)
- make dereference etc. methods (Java style for speed?)? Is there a `force` or something?
- finish tree implementation
- etc.

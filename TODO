Database core

- fsck feature (recursively resolve all references in a given object/reference and verify that the hash sums match the file contents)
- add more features to tree implementation (min, max, perhaps merge, etc.)
- change tree implementation to be just a collection, and then build both map and set on top of it
- store: implement mutable cells (both named, and anonymous (atoms))
- adapt chj.table to be storable (database tables)

Database core: context

- store should have a cache, and a context that's passed around how?
  - optimize saving of objects by checking the cache, and then possibly stat the path (or open files with EEXCL)
  - or/and keep a (weak) ref to the object in the `reference` object

Clojure and generics?

- make tree implementation work with all serializeable data types as keys
- plug into `conj`, `(:key t)`, etc.?

Fancy?

- make rb:balance pretty again (investigate `match`, extend or wrap?)
- do exceptions happen when errors happen while writing?
  - add tests with emulated OS errors
